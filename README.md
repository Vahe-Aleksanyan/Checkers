# Checkers
Checkers (American English), also known as draughts or Dama is a strategy board game for two players which involves forward movements of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces.

I used Core Java to create this game; the project required a deep knowledge of Java and oop concepts and creative solutions to do calculations on board.
